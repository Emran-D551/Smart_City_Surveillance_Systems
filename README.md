1.1 Technical Challenges

1. Accuracy and Bias in AI:

There is evidence of the inconsistency of facial recognition tools when applied to different population groups. Studies report that women, children, and people with darker skin tones are classified with higher error rates.

Low cameras quality, light variations, and occlusions (e.g., masks, sunglasses) reduce recognition accuracy.

False positives could result in wrongful suspicion, wrongful arrest, or denial of service, thus undermining trust.

2. Data Storage and Security:

Surveillance systems generate vast volumes of video and metadata that need encryption and secure storage.

Info security may be threatened and compromised through hacking or ransomware attacks.

2. System Integration:

Using AI surveillance in the existing smart city infrastructure (traffic lights, public transport, emergency services) presents interoperability challenges.

The real-time data processing requires very high computational resources, thus increasing the costs of operations.
